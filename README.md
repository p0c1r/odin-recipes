# Recipes 🥘

This is my first HTML project. It consists of 2 parts:
1. The main page called *index.html*
2. A few recipes contained as distinct HTML documents in the *recipes* folder

As I build it, I will utilize several skills obtained in the **[HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)** module of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) **[Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)** path, such as
- Basic Git usage
- Building simple webpages
- Cooking (not really from the course, though😅)
