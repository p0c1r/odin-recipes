# Recipes ðŸ¥˜

This is my first HTML project. It consists of 2 parts:
1. A simple index page named *index.html*
2. A few recipes contained as distinct HTML documents in the *recipes* folder

While making it, I will utilize several skills obtained in the first part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) **Foundations** course, such as
- Basic Git usage
- Building simple webpages
- Cooking (nah really from the course, though ðŸ˜…)
